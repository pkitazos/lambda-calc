# Untyped Lambda Calculus

Here I'm building an interactive interpreter for the untyped lambda calculus because I think it would be cool to have a way to step through the evaluation of expressions.

## Syntax

```
M, N  := x
      | Î» x . M
      | M N
```

## next:

- [ ] add top level expression aliasing to make life a little bit easier
